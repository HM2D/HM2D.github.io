			</div>
                
                <p> I started learning Unity 5(2D) in 2015 with making couple of prototypes, which you can find the project files <a href="#">here</a>. Since i'm a multiplayer fan, i tried learning HLAPI and started the project Enchanted Forest multiplayer(LAN only). An Old board game we used to play when we were kids. Till the late 2017 i managed to create couple of games and applications with Unity. Published some of them in our national app store called Bazar. My Clash Royal's Deck Builder got more than 1000 actived installs. After 2 years of 2D experience, i started working on 3D games and animations and it got me to the point where i could co-operate with Datis Pars Co and work on their Game Projects. And i've been working with them ever since including non-game applications.</p>
                <p>Making video games actually feels like playing, challenges are the bugs, respawning is where you got to try over and over to fix the bugs, you pass the level when your code works. Aside from gaming this is the only work i do that makes me so focused that i can't hear anyone and concept of time fades.</p><br>

                <p>At newcastle university i learned how to create game engines and graphic engines with C++, OpenGL, GLSL and made a fully functional game engine. Also included AI pathfinding system, Networking game system. Including working in teams and visiting and also be visited by professional game making companies. </p>

                 <h2 style="font-family:aldo the apache;">Game Design</h2>   
			</div>
                <p>By the experience i gathered from playing games throughout my life, i learned this skill. Since i've been on the both sides of the game(Player and developer), i can fairly say that i know how to challenge, amuse and even antagonize a player when needed with the rules i came to comprehend.

			</div>
                
                <p> Mostly may not be considered as a skill, but the experience i have and gained through video games in my own conceptual world is considered a skill. There is a diffrence between a noob and a pro. Don't we all gamers know that? I've been a gamer ever since i first played WWF Raw(SEGA) at the age of 4. And so with the generations i moved on to PSX, PS2, PSP, XBOX360, XBOX ONE and PC was included the whole time. I don't have the records for my gaming experience before the 7th generation since i never tried online gameplay in the 6th or before. But my profiles after the 6th gen are visible at the top of the page and they indicate all my experience.</p>
               
                <p>I've been an Author at <a style="color:orange" target="_blank" href="https://www.cheathappens.com/user_profile.asp?userID=699389">Cheathappens.com</a> since 2010 and it's the only forum i've ever been active in but not so much recently. The game community back then was amazing and it was a great help to my english and writing. Used to make trainers for my games with Cheat Engine which i learned from this website.
                    </p>
                <p> I'm <b>Founder of <a  style="color:orange" target="_blank" href="http://esl.shirazu.ac.ir/">Electronic Sports League</a> </b>(ESL) in <b>Shiraz University</b> alongside with my colleague Ali Rahimi .Since it was the first for Shiraz University we had many difficulties along the way but the attention and community of gamers we gathered that year was  exceptional. The first ESL's participants were about 200, exclusively students of ShirazU but the second year they reached <b>800</b> players and that was due to the co-operation of other universities in Shiraz. First year was he ld only for Video games and only on PC but we hosted board games too in second year. First year's leagues were Counter-Strike (Teams of 5), Generals, FIFA 14, PES 2014, Call of Duty:MW (Teams of 5), Dota 2. I participated in Counter-Strike but we got the second position! For the second year we added Dota 1, updated PES to 2016, Daliz, Otello, the last two are board games. Second year went better since we had a bigger team and better support from the university faculty. We had more sites and room for our exhibits. 
            Third year was the year the project got big and hit the  <a  style="color:orange" target="_blank" href="http://khabar.shirazu.ac.ir/News/show.aspx?ID=29032">news</a>. We managed to gather around 3000 attendants and this year it wasn't only about gaming but since i've gathered a lot of Game Programming experience we managed to add Workshops on the subject of Game Development, Game Art by inviting professionals such as <a  style="color:orange" target="_blank" href="http://www.blackcubegames.com/">Black Cube Games</a> to teach on our what we named the third year Shiraz Game Festival. It was more than just ESL or workshops. We had game rooms and game shops and other game related activities for everyone. The Festival lasted for 2 weeks and the main sponser was IT Center of Shiraz University directed by Dr.Khunjush alongside others such as <a  style="color:orange" target="_blank" href="https://www.ircg.ir/">IRCG</a>. More details are availble in the website.
            Fourth year happened in 2019 but unfortunetly i wasn't present since i was studying at United Kingdom but it feels good to know that we created something that the next generation will continue to follow as a tradition.<br><br><br></p>

If goose tries to carry a bonus item the AI will try to catch him and if so the bonus item and the ai will return to their original location.
